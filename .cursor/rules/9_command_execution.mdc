# Command Execution and Verification Rules

## Core Requirements
1. ALWAYS verify command output:
   - If a command produces no output, it likely popped out to terminal (Cursor bug)
   - Must rerun the command to verify actual results
   - Using `| cat` helps minimize but doesn't guarantee prevention
   - Never assume success without seeing output

2. Output Verification Process:
```yaml
verification:
  steps:
    1. Run command with `| cat` appended
    2. Check for output presence
    3. If no output seen:
       - Acknowledge potential pop-out
       - Rerun command
       - Continue until output is visible
    4. Only proceed after confirming output
```

3. Command Patterns:
```yaml
patterns:
  recommended:
    - "command | cat"  # Helps prevent pop-out
  required_checks:
    - Verify output presence
    - Rerun if no output
    - Never assume success without output
```

## Decision Flows
```yaml
command_execution:
  pre_execution:
    - Append "| cat" to command
    - Prepare for potential rerun
  post_execution:
    - Check for output
    - If no output:
      - Acknowledge pop-out
      - Rerun command
    - Verify results before proceeding

validation:
  output_presence:
    - Check if command produced visible output
    - If no output seen, do not assume success
    - Rerun until output is confirmed
```

## Validation Points
```yaml
validation_points:
  pre_command:
    - Append "| cat" when appropriate
    - Prepare for verification
  post_command:
    - Check output presence
    - Plan rerun if needed
  completion:
    - Verify actual results
    - Document if multiple runs needed
```

## Error Handling
```yaml
error_handling:
  no_output:
    - Do not assume command success
    - Log potential pop-out
    - Rerun command
    - Verify results
```
